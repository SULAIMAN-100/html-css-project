        <h1>Be Creative</h1>
        <p>
          As artists, we are often told to take every opportunity that comes our
          way. You never know who could be in attendance at that next gallery
          opening, what connections you will find at that event, or what could
          lead to future opportunities. But, sometimes, it’s less about saying
          “yes” and more about knowing what’s ok to give up. Habits, as you
          likely know if you were ever a nail-biter, can be incredibly hard to
          break. The invisible mental habits of ours can be even more difficult
          to overcome, but because of this, even more important. So, give
          yourself permission to quit these things. And, give yourself the time
          and patience to break the habits.
        </p>
        <h2>Give up comparisons</h2>
        <p>
          Here’s the thing about comparisons: you are always going to be better
          at some things than other people, and worse at other things. Dwelling
          on either isn’t going to get you anywhere. It can stifle your
          creativity as an emerging artist to compare yourself to someone who is
          twenty years into their career, and it can stunt your growth to
          compare your work to someone who is just starting out. Instead of
          focusing on how you stack up next to someone else, invest that energy
          into comparing your recent work with the work you made six months ago,
          a year ago and five years ago. Have you grown? And where do you want
          to see yourself six months, a year, and five years in the future?
        </p>
        <p>Only compare yourself to yourself.</p>
        <h3>YOU SHOULD BE AN ARTIST</h3>
        <p>
          Who cares you can work on Wall Street and then switch to art! Jeff
          Koons did that! I mean there are so many pathways. The traditional
          route of only working with galleries is a good option if they really
          care about your work, but there are so many outlets now. You could
          also work in an arts-related field like graphic designer, architect,
          it's your life and it's short so might as well do whatever you want
          and make all your dreams come true! It's up to you anyways. I mean
          Buddha and Jesus and Warhol are just people like us we can strive to
          be as powerful and magic as we want!
